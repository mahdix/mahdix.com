Hi!

My name is Mahdi Mohammadinasab. I am a Vice President at [Goldman Sachs Bank](http://gs.com). Most of my work experience has been with distributed and concurrent Java/Scala software systems used in fixed income investment management. In recent years I have been involved in implementing data processing pipelines (to import, validate, cleanse, group, organise, filter and store) for massive amounts of data.

You can view my [resume](https://mahdix.com/upload/Mahdi.Mohammadinasab.Resume.pdf) or visit my [weblog](https://mahdix.com/).

You can find me on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2535843/mahdix), [GitHub](https://github.com/mahdix), [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/mahdix), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mahdix).[
