     Here are some important points:
  </div>
  
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Engineers are hired to create business value, not to program things.
      </li>
      <li>
        Producing beautiful software is not a goal.  Solving complex technical problems is not a goal.  Writing bug-free code is not a goal.  Using sexy programming languages is not a goal.  Add revenue.  Reduce costs.  Those are your only goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you call yourself a programmer, someone is already working on a way to get you fired.
      </li>
      <li>
        &#8230; Describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previously employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have not had the opportunity to do this yet, describe things which suggest you have the ability to increase revenue or reduce costs, or ideas to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anyone describing themselves as either a Java programmer or .NET programmer has already lost
      </li>
      <li>
        A good engineer has a track record of — repeat after me — increasing revenue or decreasing costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        People who are skilled in negotiation make more than those who are not.
      </li>
      <li>
        The dominant quality which gets you jobs is the ability to give people the perception that you will create value.
      </li>
    </ul>
