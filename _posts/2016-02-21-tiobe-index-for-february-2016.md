[Here](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index)Â you can view the list of programming languages by popularity.

The list of somehow suspicius for me, because there are a lot of jumps in it during past one year and none of them can be justified easily. For example Objective-C is down from 14 to 4! or Perl is up from 12 to 8! Assembly is up from 26 to 13!

These things cannot happen during one year. Maybe to measurement method is not accurate, but anyway this ranking is not accurate, I think.
